<p>Universiti Teknologi MARA is a public university based primarily in Shah Alam, Malaysia, that accepts only bumiputera. It was established to help rural Malays in 1956 as the RIDA Training Centre, and opened with around 50 students. It has since grown into the largest institution of higher education in Malaysia as measured by physical infrastructure, faculty and staff, and student enrollment.</p>
